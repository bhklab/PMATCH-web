                The PMATCH project focuses on helping people with cancer access advanced treatment options by making it
                easier to find suitable clinical trials. Currently, it is challenging for doctors and researchers to
                connect patients with the right trials based on their health information. The process of checking
                whether someone qualifies for a trial requires time-consuming manual review of both patient health data
                and clinical trial information. To solve these issues, we are creating PMATCH, a computational platform
                that will use artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically match patients with clinical trials that
                offer promising cancer treatments.
